=====================

A project for my computer graphics course

To run it:

You'll need to install OpenGL. To do this on Debian-like distros,
install the "freeglut3-dev" and the "mesa-common-dev" packages.

Then go into the src directory and run "make clean ; make" to
build it and "./asteriods" to run it.

If all goes well you should see stuff happening.
